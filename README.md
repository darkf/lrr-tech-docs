# Lego(R) Rock Raiders Technical Documentation Wiki

### About

[Lego Rock Raiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Rock_Raiders_\(video_game\)) is a Lego-themed RTS game for Microsoft Windows, published 15 November 1999.

This is an attempt to document and compile resources for the technical aspects of Lego(R) Rock Raiders -- i.e. how the game engine works internally, and what file formats it uses.

This is intended to be for use in modding the game, as well as preservation and documentation purposes for whoever requires it.

This wiki is a plain [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repository hosting [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files.
This allows it to be fully *distributed* -- anyone can `git clone` the wiki and have an entire copy of it and its history, for archival or forking.

Markdown is used as it is a simple human-readable/writable format that looks close enough to plain text to be legible without a Markdown renderer.

If you wish to contribute, you may do so either via a git client, or usually via the Web interface of whatever site this is hosted on (initially GitHub -- click the edit icon on a page).
