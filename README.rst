Lego(R) Rock Raiders Technical Documentation Wiki
=================================================

About
~~~~~

`Lego(R) Rock Raiders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Rock_Raiders_(video_game)>`_ is a Lego(R)-themed Real Time Strategy game for
PCs (and the PlayStation 1, which is not covered here), released on
November 15, 1999.

This is an attempt to document and compile resources for the technical
aspects of Lego(R) Rock Raiders – i.e. how the game engine works
internally, and what file formats it uses.

This is intended to be for use in modding the game, as well as
preservation and documentation purposes for whoever requires it.

This wiki is a plain `Git`_ repository hosting `reStructuredText`_ files. This
allows it to be fully *distributed* – anyone can ``git clone`` the wiki
and have an entire copy of it and its history, for archival or forking.

reStructuredText is used as it is a simple human-readable/writable format that
looks close enough to plain text to be legible without a renderer.
It is also more featureful for a wiki than Markdown is.

If you wish to contribute, you may do so either via a git client, or
usually via the Web interface of whatever site this is hosted on
(initially GitHub – click the edit icon on a page).
