Textures
========

The game stores textures for `models <Models.md>`_ as 8-bit paletted `BMPs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format>`_.

They do not support an alpha channel, so alpha is done in one of two
ways:

-  Chroma keying by filename
-  Additive blending through the LightWave surface

Chroma Keying
-------------

In this method, the filename of the BMP itself indicates the color used
for transparency.

The files are named in the format ``A###_foo.BMP`` where ``###`` is a
3-digit number which corresponds to an index into the BMPâ€™s color
palette. [1]_ [2]_ That color is then considered transparent in
the BMP.

Additive Blending
-----------------

For the more subtle *transluscency* used in lighting (e.g. in the model
``Buildings/Powerstation/spangleY.lwo``), `additive blending <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes#Addition>`_ is used. [2]_

This is specified in the LightWave surface, in the "Advanced" tab. See
the screenshot at [2]_.

I am currently unaware of how this is stored in the model itself,
although my current hypothesis is that it is in either the ``DIFF`` or
``LUMI`` sub-chunks (in ``SURF``), when bit 9 ("Additive") is set in the
value for the ``FLAG`` sub-chunk.
